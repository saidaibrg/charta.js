# Charta.js - jot down your thoughts anytime, anywhere.

This library can help you include a compact text editor with cloud storage into your web application.

* Inspired by Sticky Notes application on Mac. Can this library offer the handiness of Sticky Notes, but at the same time store all data securely?
* Auto-saving feature would be important.  
* This library could be integrated into web conferencing software, learning platforms, browsers...
* Please add more of your thoughts!  
* Ideas:
  * A visual timeline with previous versions of a note
